# ASIM Specification

This project contains the coreASIM models and specifications for the Interlace project. The aim is to provide a software requirements engineering process which might be later extended to a model driven architecture approach.

Currently, the project is in an early state and might not be fully usable yet

## Important Notes

the entry point for the execution of the specification shall remain

```bash
run.icef
```

in order to offer a standard file when trying to run the ASIM specification.

## Execution

The *run.icef* contains the INTERLACE requirements specifications. These are based on Interaction Computing Environment Framework (ICEF). For how to install the ICEF which can actually execute *run.icef*, refer to the sources developed by the BIOMICS project at github under [biomics/icef](https://github.com/biomics/icef)

However, if you do not like to install the framework by yourself you are also provided (a) virtual environment(s) which can be also found on github under [InterlaceProject/ASIMVagrantEnvironment](https://github.com/InterlaceProject/ASIMVagrantEnvironment).
