# ASIM Specification

This project contains the coreASIM models and specifications for the Interlace project. The aim is to provide a software requirements engineering process which might be later extended to a model driven architecture approach.

Currently, the project is in an early state and might not be fully usable yet

## Important Notes

the entry point for the execution of the specification shall remain

```bash
run.icef
```

in order to offer a standard file when trying to run the ASIM specification.

## Execution

The *run.icef* can be used to run the INTERLACE requirements specifications. For how to install the interaction computing environment framework (icef) which can actually run these refer to the sources developed by the BIOMICS project at github under [biomics/icef](https://github.com/biomics/icef)

However, if you do not like to install the framework by yourself you are also provided (a) virtual environment(s) which can be also found on github under [InterlaceProject/ASIMVagrantEnvironment](https://github.com/InterlaceProject/ASIMVagrantEnvironment).
